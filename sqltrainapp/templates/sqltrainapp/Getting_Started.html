                href="questions/basic/">open the exercises</a>, take a look at the questions, and try to answer them!
        </p>
            <p>The dataset for these exercises is for a newly created country club, with a set of members, facilities
                such as tennis courts, and booking history for those facilities. Amongst other things, the club wants to
                understand how they can use their information to analyse facility usage/demand. <b>Please note:</b> this
                dataset is designed purely for supporting an interesting array of exercises, and the database schema is
                flawed in several aspects - please don't take it as an example of good design. We'll start off with a
                look at the Members table:</p></div>

            member who made the booking, the start of the booking, and how many half hour 'slots' the booking was made
            for. This idiosyncratic design will make certain queries more difficult, but should provide you with some
            interesting challenges - as well as prepare you for the horror of working with some real-world databases
            :-).</p>
            <p>Okay, that should be all the information you need. You can select a category of query to try from the
                menu above, or alternatively <a href="questions/basic/">start from the beginning</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-body col-md-8"><h3 style="margin-top:20px">I want to use my own Postgres system</h3>
            <p>No problem! Getting up and running isn't too hard. First, you'll need an install of PostgreSQL, which you
                can get from <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/">here</a>. Once you have it started, <a
                        href="dbfiles/clubdata.sql">download the SQL</a>.</p>
            <p>Finally, run <span class="code">psql -U &lt;username&gt; -f clubdata.sql -d postgres -x -q</span> to
                create the 'exercises' database, the Postgres 'pgexercises' user, the tables, and to load the data in.
                Note that you may find that the sort order of your results differs from those shown on the web site:
                that's probably because your Postgres is set up using a different locale to that used by PGExercises
                (which uses the C locale)</p>
            <p>When you're running queries, you may find psql a little clunky. If so, I recommend trying out pgAdmin or
                the Eclipse database development tools.</p></div>
