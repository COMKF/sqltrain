            <p>This category deals primarily with a foundational concept in relational database systems: joining.
                Joining allows you to combine related information from multiple tables to answer a question. This isn't
                just beneficial for ease of querying: a lack of join capability encourages denormalisation of data,
                which increases the complexity of keeping your data internally consistent.
            <p>This topic covers inner, outer, and self joins, as well as spending a little time on subqueries (queries
                within queries). If you struggle with these questions, I strongly recommend <a

                concise and well-written book on the subject.</p> </p> </div>
